                                                                <p>The community of participants of Astro Hack Week is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.</p>

In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</li>
                                                                    <li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.</li>
                                                                    <li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.</li>
                                                                    <li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community.</li>

We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.</li>
                                                                    <li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct.
